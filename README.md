# Heli3Dof

A simple 3‑degree‑of‑freedom helicopter model. The original implementation was
in MATLAB; this repository now provides a basic Python version with
visualisation utilities and a Jupyter notebook ready for Google Colab.

## Requirements

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the tests

```
pytest
```

## Using the notebook

Open `Heli3Dof.ipynb` in Jupyter or upload it to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). It demonstrates how to compute the kinematics,
simulate a simple PD controller and visualise the result.
